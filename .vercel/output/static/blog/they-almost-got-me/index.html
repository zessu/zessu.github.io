<h4 id="-intro"><code>🔵 Intro</code></h4>
<p>For the last year or so I’ve been working on a lot of freelancing type of work and also acting as a consultant to help companies build things, you know what consultants do - come in and advice on microservice migrations for example as well as coding for my startup(more on this soon enough). But I’ve also been working on web3 projects, from building an NFT generator to web3 security, studying Ethereum Smart Contract security and auding, building a functioning wallet drainer with modern bypasses for things like Metamask, ScamSniffer e.t.c Getting my knowledge in cybersecurity and malware development further a long with practical knowledge (for educational purposes only of course).</p>
<p>I’ve recently wanted to go back to coding for a company (I miss working under a team) and thus I have been looking for a job at a company/industry I would be passionate working in e.g. web3, fintech. I came across this <a href="https://devremote.io/jobs/remote-Senior-Blockchain-and-Software-Developer-1749436051">Job Ad</a> for <strong>CoinList</strong> a company I know well, subscribed to their newsletter for a couple of years and thought “well lemme apply to work for them”. <strong>$16000</strong> a month, enticing offer, the promise of a quick interview process and so I clicked apply. This took my to a google form, that looked legitimate, but wasn’t. I did not realize this at the time and was redirected to the form from a website that I have used before and trust ie <a href="https://devremote.io/">https://devremote.io/</a>. I did not think to double check the URL to make sure I was applying off the official CoinList website or a valid domain. But again job applications usually take you to their hiring partners e.g greenhouse so I won’t beat myself up about this too much.</p>
<p>Anyway, after the application, a couple of hours later, I received an invitation from a supposed CoinList account on Github <a href="https://github.com/TrCoinList/TrCoinList">TrCoinList/TrCoinList</a> inviting me to collaborate on a project. Immediately my spider senses started tingling.</p>
<p><img src="/images/malware/github-inv.png"><br></p>
<h4 id="-initial-doubt"><code>🔺 Initial Doubt</code></h4>
<p>For anyone who has ever applied for a tech job, the usual process goes like this. 1. You apply for a job 2. You get a confirmation email from the company 3. You get a recruiter reaching out to you on LinkedIn/Email, trying to find out about your availability and schedule meetings.</p>
<p>When I did not get an official email confirmation or a recruiter reaching out directly but a cold, <em>“CoinList invited you to collaborate on a project”</em>, I sensed something was off. Could CoinList be this unprofessional? Had they accidentally added me to the project before sending me an email? This can happen if there is bad coordination between different departments or if the company does not have the right tools/systems. The “take home” project also had SAAS features like Invoice Management , Inventory Management, Accounting Management, HR Management none of which are connected to web3 or anything CoinList does.</p>
<p>At this point, as someone who is actively learning cybersecurity, getting into malware development, writing C shellcode scripts to bypass windows defender and exfiltrate data from computers unnoticed e.t.c I knew that I had to do my due dilligence before downloading and running the code. Something was not right. So I decided to check that the code was good before I decided to run it on my computer.</p>
<h4 id="-malware-analysis"><code>🦠 Malware analysis</code></h4>
<p>I git clone the project into my local machine(don’t worry I wont run it), then immediately go over to <a href="https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/auth/auth_success_gemini">gemini-cli</a> and ask it to analyze the code for malicious files. 🤣🤣 I know, anti-climactic. Seriously though, the project has hundreds of files each with 100 lines at least, I was not going to painstakingly go through every single line to find malware in there. If you have set up a VM(Virtual Machine) you can run the malware in the VM then open process explorer and attempt to follow the program’s execution tree, or use <a href="http://any.run/">http://any.run/</a> or <a href="http://virustotal.com/">http://virustotal.com/</a> to scan executables. AI is really good at this kind of stuff. It obviously makes the whole process faster. Finding malware in code would typically require you to analyze the code line by line to find any funky control flow or obfuscated code. AI did this in less than 20 seconds.</p>
<p>I should also mention that sometimes malware developers can embed instructions somewhere in the code to manipulate AI instructions such as to not raise suspicion over some lines of code. I’d read this article a couple of months before this incident, <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-prompt-injection-attack">What Is a Prompt Injection Attack? [Examples &#x26; Prevention] - Palo Alto Networks</a> so I was aware of that and other techniques a threat actor could use when asking for a scan from Gemini.</p>
<p>Immediately after the scan, Gemini alerts me to malicious code in the <code>/home/kali/code/coinlist/TrCoinList/src/utils/searchFeatures.js</code> file. Opening this file on Github or VS-Code, this is all you can see. Notice the massive scroll lines at the bottom, on Github. It looks like you’ve hit the end of the code but you’d have to scroll right to see some extra code that exists on the file.</p>
<img src="/images/malware/github-scroll.png">
<p><br><br>
Malware authors often add lots of spacing and padding to code or files they send you, pushing the malicious code beyond the visible view port. VS Code is much worse as it doesn’t render horizontal scrollbars in this scenario, so there are literally no signs except for some obvious gaps in the minimap view.</p>
<br>
<img src="/images/malware/vscode-scroll.png">
<br>
View of the minimap. There still arent any signs of any code here. I know this is super zoomed out but concentrate on the highlighted area on the minimap
<br>
<img src="/images/malware/vscode-bar.png"><br>
<p>Luckily I use <code>neovim</code> <a href="https://nvchad.com/">https://nvchad.com/</a> and was easily able to see the malicious code as neovim renders without horizontal scrollbars so code is forced onto the next line. <br></p>
<p><img src="/images/malware/nvim.png"> <br></p>
<p>The code is obfuscated, a technique that makes the code harder to read, as you can hopefully tell. This technique is used by malware devs to hide malicious intent from human readers and AV(anti-virus) programs but it can be used for legitimate purposes e.g to make harder code to reverse engineer for IP(Intellectual Property) protection.</p>
<p>De-obfuscating code is not something you want to do manually, unless you are reading inline assembly. There are programs that allow you to do this easily. We could use a program like <a href="https://deobfuscate.io/">JavaScript Deobfuscator</a> or just use AI to do it 🤣. That laugh is imposter syndrome right there. I am learning to use AI as a digital assistant so I can spend my time doing other things and being more productive. We ask Google’s Gemini to de-obfuscate the code and write it to a separate file for us so we can analyze the code ourselves. Here is the output</p>
<p><img src="/images/malware/code1.png"> <br>
<img src="/images/malware/code2.png"> <br></p>
<p>As you can see, the code loads some modules like <strong>exec</strong> <strong>fs</strong>, <strong>os</strong>, <strong>path</strong>, <strong>zlib</strong>. If you used <strong>node</strong> you might know <code>exec</code> is used to spawn a child process which can be used to execute commands e.g <code>ls -la</code> <code>wget</code> e.t.c, <code>fs</code> is used to access the file system, <code>os</code> can be used to get <code>os</code> information like user, ipaddress, MAC address, <code>path</code> can be used to traverse your directiories and <code>zlib</code> is used to compress data before exfiltration.</p>
<p>We can see the malware get some system information before sending this data out in a request to a server. The malware automatically runs once the file is imported(in the code), the request module sends your system information to a C2(command and control) server. url <code>@https://bin.checkcrm.com/a/users</code>. The code then gets the response from the server under <code>body.command</code> and runs the <code> executeBackdoorCommand</code>. These server response(commands) could be <code>ls -la</code> or even<code>rm -rf ~/</code> 🥶</p>

<span class="line"><span>30   │   },</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>31   │ );</span></span></code></pre>
<br>
Other commands the server could send could spawn powershell, run some shellcode giving them full remote access to your computer. To delete files, install keyloggers, install a RAT (remote access trojan).
<p><br><br>
Although the malware code is not particularly novel or interesting (the backdoor does not persist and only runs when you run project through a start command e.g <code>bun run dev</code>, it’s the social engineering behind it that is impressive. How many of us would run suspicious code some stranger sent us on the internet? Probably none. But a code assessment as part of an interview? We have all done it. Had I gotten the email from the recruiter, might I have run the code without second guessing the code? Yes, likely.</p>
<p>After I built a RAT(Remote Access Trojan) into a seemingly innocent PNG cat image and a PDF file, that you click and it gives me remote access to your computer, I have learned to be a little bit more cautious about security and about files that people send me. At least I hope that’s why I was able to catch this and not the threat actors obvious faults. I think its fair to say a lot of developers would fall for these kind of schemes, and malware developers are always scheming. Some lessons learned, and a near accident avoided, I guess we have to talk about the next topic</p>
<h4 id="️-how-to-protect-yourself"><code>⚔️ How to protect yourself</code></h4>
<p>It goes without saying. <strong>Do not run other people’s code on your computer</strong>. Of course your operating system, VLC media player etc are other people’s code. But I mean do not run code people send you online on your computer. Make sure you download code from safe repositories e.g. microsoft’s store, official websites e.t.c If you want to run code that an interviewer sent you, I would recommend that you use a VM(Virtual Machine). I would also recommend using a VM to open any PDF’s people send you online as well. These could also be infected with malware. You might want to invest in a secondary computer, or a computer you could RDP(remote desktop into) and run code there.</p>
<p>Knowledge. <strong>Educate yourself</strong>. Stay aware and build knowledge. Educate yourself on schemes attackers could use. e.g If the attacker had used some prompt injection techniques in the malware-they did not and I did not know this or know about the bypasses, I might not have known to inform AI about this possibility. Example of prompt injection</p>

<p><strong>Double check</strong>. Double check any urls you open, any emails you get to confirm the authorities you are talking to are legit and valid. Know their attack vectors, enticing job offers, free software.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your antivirus updated</strong>. Malware can get you from any angle, including crack programs you download online. You do not want to download crack programs or download programs from sketchy websites.</p>
<p><strong>Security Extensions</strong>. Security extensions like <code>windows defender browser protection</code>. <code>duckduckgo protection</code>, <code>scam sniffer</code> e.t.c</p>
<p><strong>Safely store your keys and passwords</strong> using things like Nordpass. This lets you have strong secure passwords, store your notes securely and actively manage your password security better.</p>
<p><strong>Stay quiet and reduce your attack surface</strong>. Do not go advertising you have $5m in crypto on your wallet. You will be targeted by people with more security knowledge than you do. Be quiet, stay in the shadows.</p>
<h4 id="-update"><code>🧭 Update</code></h4>
<p>The threat actor reached out to me on LinkedIn trying to connect and asking me to complete the assessment. This was a day after I’d started writing this article. Of course at this point, I already knew what was going on so I called them out and reported their account to linkedin. <em>They blocked me</em>.</p>
<p>Find links to the deobfuscated malware on my <a href="https://github.com/zessu/TrCoinList/blob/main/deobfuscated-malware.js">github</a>. This repository does not have any malware but I would not recommend you to run it. I have been blocked by the organisation but I found a link to the <strong>malicious code</strong> <a href="https://github.com/super-devninja/TrCoinList/blob/main/src/utils/searchFeatures.js">Here</a> showing the weird scroll padding.</p>
