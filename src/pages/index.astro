			<h3>Hi There! I am Andrew ðŸ‘‹</h3>
			<p>
				Welcome to my blog. I will update this on a continuous basis. I am a software developer
				and a music producer. I love working with typescript, react, bun, graphql, aws cdk, toying with and designing infrastructure.
				<br />I work both on the frontend and backend and I am conversant with React Native for designing mobile applications.
				<br /><br />
				I also work with blockchains, specializing in solidity mostly within the ethereum ecosystem.
				In my free time I like to write music, do some learning, go try out new food and restaurants, go to the beach and generally have a good time
				<br /><br />
